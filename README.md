# Health Insurance Premium Prediction

Welcome to the **Health Insurance Premium Prediction System** â€” a complete machine learning solution designed to predict annual health insurance premiums based on personal and health-related attributes. This project integrates **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and a **Streamlit application** for intuitive predictions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/An1sh-D/ml-health-insurance-premium-prediction.git
cd ml-health-insurance-premium-prediction
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed, then install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Run Data Processing Pipelines

Run any of the processing scripts based on your needs. For example:

```bash
python insuranc_premium_overall.py
```

---

### 4. Launch the Streamlit Application

Navigate to the `App` directory (if your main Streamlit script is there) or project root and run:

```bash
streamlit run App/main.py
```

> The Streamlit app will open automatically in your default web browser.

## Testing

Basic functional tests are embedded within scripts (e.g. shape checks, prints). For extending this project with **pytest unit tests**, create a `tests/` directory and include pipeline, preprocessing, and model tests.
